Hii there! Let me introduce myself, I am Agent Daniel.
I need your help asap.
Agent Jack is an investigator working on a cybercrime case. Unfortunately, Agent Jack has been declared missing since this morning.
However, before Agent Jack disappeared, he gave me this note.

Agent Daniel, 

I've found a file that could serve as strong evidence in the case we're working on. 
But, I'm sorry, this file is encrypted with an algorithm that I'm not familiar with.
I managed to find fragments of the key for decryption. 
I hope what I've found will be useful for you.

Jack

I believe you can help me.
Please, help me... :(
